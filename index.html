    <p>It has been almost two decades in the making, but late on Saturday night in New York, after days of gruelling round-the-clock talks, UN member states finally agreed on a treaty to protect the high seas.
    <br>
    A full day after the deadline for talks had officially passed, the conference president, Rena Lee of Singapore, took to the floor of room 2 of the UN headquarters in New York and announced that the treaty had been agreed. At a later date, the delegates will meet for half a day to formally adopt the text. She made it clear the text would not be reopened.
    <br>
    “In Singapore, we like to go on learning journeys, and this has been the learning journey of a lifetime,” Lee said.
    <br>
    She thanked delegates for their dedication and commitment. “The success is also yours,” she told them.
    <br>
    She received cheers and a standing ovation from delegates in the room who had not left the conference hall for two days and worked through the night in order to get the deal done.
